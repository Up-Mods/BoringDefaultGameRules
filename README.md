# Boring Template

Welcome to my personal template! It's a fork of [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) meant to fit my own needs like supporting the latest JDK, matching the usual standard of my mods, using GitHub Actions, etc. but you are free to use it as well!

## Usage

You should be able to setup Boring Template for your own usage by the same way you setup the Fabric Example Mod template. All instances of `modid` must be replaced with the real mod id.
